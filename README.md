# CDI

Cimetiere des innocents, or, Common Distribution Infrastracture

Some basic library for my C++ projects.

Boosting, Abseil & folly are good libraries. They are versatile, fast and incredibly well design & tested.

However, they are quite large and slow down compiler speed drastically, so it came to me that I needed to write my own common libs.
